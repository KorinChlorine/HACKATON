The python file website visits https://www.tsu.edu.ph/ and gets the latest news articles and anouncements. It takes a jpg of them to be used as resources on the Unreal Engine game.
Run the python file to generate the jpgs before running the Unreal Engine app.

The python program assumes you have firefox installed
Dependencies of the python script are selenium, beautifulsoup4, and pillow

Run the command below assuming you already have python installed
```pip install selenium beautifulsoup4 pillow```

Then you can just run python website.py to generate jpgs of news and anouncements
